# XPath

> XML Path Language

It uses a non-XML syntax to provide a flexible way of addressing (pointing to) different parts of an XML document. It can also be used to test addressed nodes within a document to determine whether they match a pattern or not.

XPath is mainly used in XLST, but can also be used as a much more powerful way of navigating through the DOM of any XML-like language document using **XPathExpression**, such as HTML and SVG.

XPath uses a path notation (as in URLs) for navigating through the hierarchical structure of an XML document. It uses a non-XML syntax so that it can be used in URIs and XML attribute values.
