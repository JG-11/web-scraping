# Callback or "call-after" function

> Definition

A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked outside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

**Example:**

The above example is a **synchronous** callback, as it is executed immediately. But, callbacks are often also used to continue code execution after an **asynchronous** operation has completed (**asynchronous callbacks**). This is the idea behind many modern web APIs, such as **fetch()**.
